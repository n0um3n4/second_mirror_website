<!--
I like the idea of doing impossible things.
I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
I like to try and make it real.
Would you partake?
Contact me.

      <h2>The human being I'm trying to be</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Preserve</em>, not to destroy. Wield power to do good.
        </li>
        <li>
          Real <em>strength</em> lies in domestication of one's emotions: not in pretending they don't exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Educate</em> yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Courage</em> and <em>humility</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>My values</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>
            Honor others
          </em>
          No matter what degree, title or lack of it, everyone has something to offer. 
          It takes a village to raise a child. We all have a role to fulfill.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Empower others
          </em>
          Things are hard and complex. We all are doomed to make mistakes.
          Making room for mistakes allow us to grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Privilege people
          </em>
          Existence is pain and this system we have created only make things harder.
          Remember we are flying away on a gigant rock. 
          Don't get dragged away by irrelevant things like profit, titles, ego, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Serve with humility
          </em>
          We all have room for improvement, recognize it. Listen to others' feedback
          and be open to criticism.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Things I believe</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>
            How can I help?
          </em>
          I think the only way to be the best leader is by being of service to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I will hold your heart more tenderly than my own.
          </em>
          I will. For some reason I think I can take all the pain in the Cosmos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            The less forgivable the act, the more must be forgiven. The less loveable the person is, the more you must find the means to love them.
          </em>
          I have learnt that the hard way but I believe I must follow such principle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I think everyone has something to offer and they are always open to do that.
          </em>
          The problem is there are so many things affecting us that we tend to be mean to each other, however, this means I believe humans have a good heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Any one has the capacity to become awesome at something.
          </em>
          The reasons why people look for expertise, in the end I believe, has nothing to do with the actual matter. I'd rather collaborate with someone up for a challange than with some expert on the matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            We need one another.
          </em>
          Anyone can do things on its own... Perhaps not everything. However, I believe doing things together makes the experience more fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            You are going to fail.
          </em>
          And so will I. That's the way it is and I'm fine with the logic behind. Do fail. By all means, do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I'm an open book. I trust you by default.
          </em>
          And if you decide to break that trust, that's alright. You will save me some time. I'm all about creating long lasting friendships and time is of the essence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            There are social conventions, social cues and sugar coding. I don't understand any of them.
          </em>
          Just be straight with me. I won't get offended. Otherwise, there will be misunderstanding. I guarantee that.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>

      <h2>My flaws through time</h2>

      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>
            I enjoy people in very, very short amounts of time:
          </em>
          I get bored. It's not people's fault but rather that I'm poorly made. After a few decades on the planet I finally know why. The reason why I can't be too much around people is because I'm happy. And when I'm happy my baggage, my childhood traumas, push me away as a defense mechanism. I don't want to lose that happiness. I don't want to lose that people in my life. This is quite sad since I cannot fix that. I can only cope with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I'm way too idealistic:
          </em>
I find impossible things very appealing so I aim to that.
</li>
<li>
<em>
I hate myself:
</em>
Most of the time my stupidity doesn't pay off so...
</li>
<li>
<em>
I tend to be the stand up guy:
          </em>
          but I think it's because deep down I want to be the hero. Because heroes get to be loved and accepted. And, as I have discovered, I was rejected since early childhood and in so I have no place where I feel at home.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I'm not sure about anything:
          </em>
          I blame my training in physics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I'm very pessimistic:
          </em>
          My pessimism is the fuel of my optimism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I get bored a lot:
          </em>
          This most likely is a brain issue. A brain issue what was fixed at early stage of childhood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I need to be busy:
          </em>
          I used to believe it was an existential reason but now I know it's because my childhood trauma.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I care how I dress:
          </em>
          Well, I do. I enjoy fashion as art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I care how I look:
          </em>
          When you are not handsome, all you have is artificial aesthetics.
        </li>
