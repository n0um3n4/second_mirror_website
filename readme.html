<!--
I like the idea of doing impossible things.
I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
I like to try and make it real.
Would you partake?
Contact me.

      <h2>The human being I'm trying to be</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Preserve</em>, not to destroy. Wield power to do good.
        </li>
        <li>
          Real <em>strength</em> lies in domestication of one's emotions: not in pretending they don't exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Educate</em> yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Courage</em> and <em>humility</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>My values</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>
            Honor others
          </em>
          No matter what degree, title or lack of it, everyone has something to offer.
          It takes a village to raise a child. We all have a role to fulfill.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Empower others
          </em>
          Things are hard and complex. We all are doomed to make mistakes.
          Making room for mistakes allow us to grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Privilege people
          </em>
          Existence is pain and this system we have created only make things harder.
          Remember we are flying away on a gigant rock.
          Don't get dragged away by irrelevant things like profit, titles, ego, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Serve with humility
          </em>
          We all have room for improvement, recognize it. Listen to others' feedback
          and be open to criticism.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Things I believe</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>
            Reversed Trust
          </em>
          Usually we earn respect and trust by working on it. In my case, I believe in trusting and respecting others since the beginning 100%.
          They work on keeping that. In my experience, people start showing you who they real are and therefore the trust and respect may decrease.
          This is not great since I've been abused and hurt. But I believe in a human's good heart. Granted, maybe naive but that's who I am.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            How can I help?
          </em>
          I think the only way to be the best leader is by being of service to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I will hold your heart more tenderly than my own.
          </em>
          I will. For some reason I think I can take all the pain in the Cosmos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            The less forgivable the act, the more must be forgiven. The less loveable the person is, the more you must find the means to love them.
          </em>
          I have learnt that the hard way but I believe I must follow such principle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I think everyone has something to offer and they are always open to do that.
          </em>
          The problem is there are so many things affecting us that we tend to be mean to each other, however, this means I believe humans have a good heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Any one has the capacity to become awesome at something.
          </em>
          The reasons why people look for expertise, in the end I believe, has nothing to do with the actual matter. I'd rather collaborate with someone up for a challange than with some expert on the matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            We need one another.
          </em>
          Anyone can do things on its own... Perhaps not everything. However, I believe doing things together makes the experience more fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            You are going to fail.
          </em>
          And so will I. That's the way it is and I'm fine with the logic behind. Do fail. By all means, do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            I'm an open book. I trust you by default.
          </em>
          And if you decide to break that trust, that's alright. You will save me some time. I'm all about creating long lasting friendships and time is of the essence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            There are social conventions, social cues and sugar coding. I don't understand any of them.
          </em>
          Just be straight with me. I won't get offended. Otherwise, there will be misunderstanding. I guarantee that.
