<!--
    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?
    Contact me.

            <h2>An Artificial Consciousness</h2>

            <p>
            Why would anyone want to create a consciousness being? Existence is pain and life is absurd. The most of the problems we have, I think, have the same root: <em>life is brief and death is certain</em> and humans cannot deal with that fact.

            <p>
                Why, then, anyone want to do that?
